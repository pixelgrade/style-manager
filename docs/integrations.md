# Integrations

By default, Style Manager "knows" to play nicely with certain other WordPress plugins:

## Autoptimize

Style Manager makes sure that [Autoptimize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autoptimize/) doesn't move or mess with the WebFontLoader script. This is important for a predictable behavior. 

## WP-Rocket

Style Manager makes sure that [WP-Rocket](https://wp-rocket.me/) doesn't mess with the WebFontLoader script or some of our inline scripts. This is important for a predictable behavior.

## WP Fastest Cache

Style Manager makes sure that [WP Fastest Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fastest-cache/) doesn't minify the WebFontLoader script. This is important for a predictable behavior.

## W3 Total Cache

Style Manager makes sure that [W3 Total Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/) doesn't minify the WebFontLoader script. This is important for a predictable behavior.

## The Events Calendar (including the PRO version)

Style Manager makes sure that [The Events Calendar](https://theeventscalendar.com/) doesn't conflict with our Select2 script version.
