# Installation

As a standard WordPress plugin, installation is the same as most other plugins. This can be done by uploading the plugin as a zip file, or using Composer.

Style Manager tries to stay with the minimum PHP version required by WordPress core. Thus it requires PHP 5.6.20 or later.

__PHP 7.4+ is highly recommended!__

## Zip File

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/pixelgrade/style-manager/releases/latest) from GitHub (use the asset named `style-manager-{version}.zip`) or from [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/style-manager/).
2. Go to the _Plugins &rarr; Add New_ screen in your WordPress admin panel and click the __Upload Plugin__ button at the top.
3. Upload the zipped archive.
4. Click the __Activate Plugin__ link after installation completes.
